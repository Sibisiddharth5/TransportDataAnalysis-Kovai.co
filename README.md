# TransportDataAnalysis-Kovai.co
Overview
This project predicts the daily number of passengers for various transit services — Local Route, Light Rail, Peak Service, Rapid Route, and School — for the upcoming week. Using historical passenger data, it helps transit planners anticipate demand and manage resources better.

What’s Inside
Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the daily passenger count data for modeling.

Forecasting with Prophet: Using Facebook’s Prophet model to predict passenger counts for the next 7 days.

Visualizations: Graphs showing actual and predicted passenger trends.

Output: Tables with predicted values and confidence intervals for each service.

How to Use
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.7+ recommended).

Install the required packages using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install prophet matplotlib pandas
Load your dataset as a pandas DataFrame.

Run the forecasting script (forecast.py or similar) to generate predictions and plots.

Review the output tables for predicted passenger counts with upper and lower confidence bounds.

Why Prophet?
Prophet is designed to handle time series data with strong seasonal effects and works well even when data has missing points or outliers. It’s simple to use and provides reliable short-term forecasts, making it ideal for transit passenger forecasting.

Example Output
Date	Service	Predicted	Lower Bound	Upper Bound
2024-09-30	Local Route	10605	6571	14739
2024-10-01	Local Route	12401	8048	16211

Notes
The forecast horizon is 7 days by default but can be adjusted.

Confidence intervals provide a range where actual values are likely to fall.

The model assumes historical trends continue; unexpected events may affect accuracy.
